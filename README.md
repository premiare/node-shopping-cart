# Shopping Cart - built with node.js using readline

This application can be used interactively and staticly, allowing mocha to run the tests.

To run the interactive node.js application, run:
` npm start `

The interactive application is written with <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html">Readline</a>

To run the mocha.js testing, run:
`npm test`

The two tests are: <br>
```Test 1: Create a Shopping cart, then add 2 "Apple" products for $4.95 each and 1 "Orange" Product for $3.99, and check that the ShoppingCart total price is correct.``` <br><br>
```Test 2: Create a Shopping Cart and add 3 "Apple" products, then remove 1 "Apple" product, and check that total price is correct.```
